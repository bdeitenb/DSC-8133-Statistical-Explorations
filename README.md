# DSC-8133-Statistical-Explorations
This notebook explores basic descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques using a real-world dataset from the 1988 U.S. Army Anthropometry Survey (ANSUR II). The dataset includes measurements from male and female members of the armed forces, such as height (cm), weight (kg), sex, and BMI.

Originally sourced from UMTRI, the data was cleaned and converted by Jonathan Barlow (Mississippi State University). This notebook demonstrates how to apply summary statistics and exploratory plots to better understand human body metrics.
